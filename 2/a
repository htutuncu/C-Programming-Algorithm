A palindrome consists of a word or deblanked, unpunctuated phrase that is
spelled exactly the same when the letters are reversed. Write a recursive func-
tion that returns a value of 1 if its string argument is a palindrome. Notice that in
palindromes such as level, deed, sees, and Madam Iâ€™m Adam (madamimadam),
the first letter matches the last, the second matches the next-to-last, and so on.
