# 2 - Palindrome 
A palindrome consists of a word or deblanked, unpunctuated phrase that is
spelled exactly the same when the letters are reversed. Write a recursive func-
tion that returns a value of 1 if its string argument is a palindrome. Notice that in
palindromes such as level, deed, sees, and Madam I’m Adam (madamimadam),
the first letter matches the last, the second matches the next-to-last, and so on.

# 3 - Recursive Function

Write and test a recursive function that returns the value of the following
recursive definition:
f ( x ) = 0                     if x <= 0
f ( x ) = f ( x - 1) + 2        otherwise
What set of numbers is generated by this definition?

# Hangman Game
An interactive program that plays a game of hangman. Store the word to
be guessed in successive elements of an array of individual characters called
word. 

# Merge Arrays
A function that will merge the contents of two sorted (ascending order)
arrays of type double values, storing the result in an array output parameter
(still in ascending order). The function should not assume that both its input
parameter arrays are the same length but can assume that one array does not
contain two copies of the same value. The result array should also contain no
duplicate values.
