# 2 - Palindrome 
A palindrome consists of a word or deblanked, unpunctuated phrase that is
spelled exactly the same when the letters are reversed. Write a recursive func-
tion that returns a value of 1 if its string argument is a palindrome. Notice that in
palindromes such as level, deed, sees, and Madam Iâ€™m Adam (madamimadam),
the first letter matches the last, the second matches the next-to-last, and so on.

# 3 - Recursive Function

Write and test a recursive function that returns the value of the following
recursive definition:
f ( x ) = 0                     if x <= 0
f ( x ) = f ( x - 1) + 2        otherwise
What set of numbers is generated by this definition?
